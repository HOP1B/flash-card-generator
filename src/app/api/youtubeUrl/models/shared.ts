criminals were just wandering around the yard doing nothing Cubit proposed his invention the tread wheel it was a 2 m wheel with 24 steps walking in unison the prisoners would Ascend an imaginary endless Hill and as a bonus they ground grain however the prison Warden decided that grinding grain was a necessary but as a punishment for the unruly it was perfect the daily Norm was set at 16,639 1902 the tread wheel was recognized as inhumane and abolished 11 years later Claude Hagen improved the tread wheel and invented the treadmill so from an instrument of torture it became still an instrument of torture you should know how much energy drink can be lethal energy drinks consist of four main ingredients that pose a risk caffeine tarine Gana and gingo baloba one energy drink won&amp;#39;t do much harm and even two maybe just an upset stomach two servings of energy drinks don&amp;#39;t exceed the safe daily caffeine limit but each subsequent one risks causing dizziness nausea arhythmia and increased blood pressure however even after the 20th serving you&amp;#39;re far from overdosing because the lethal dose for example of caffeine is 0.6 o for an adult and after that no drink will bring you back to life if you don&amp;#39;t understand how much of that is imagine your stomach filled to the brim with liquid and you still have another 12 gallons of unconsumed energy drink Arnold are you planning to extinguish the volcano with water interesting idea but First dress properly to protect yourself from the Heat and volcano splashes volcanologist to wear protective aluminum suits but don&amp;#39;t forget about a respirator due to the gases emitted by the volcano speaking of gases if the volcano especially an active one is submerged in water it may lead to the creation of steam pressure water can penetrate cracks and pores inside the magma when magma contains water the water begins to evaporate forming steam due to the steam pressure builds up which leads to an I didn&amp;#39;t finish telling you about that well Arnold at least you&amp;#39;ve learned to fly if you fall into lava you won&amp;#39;t drown immediately lava is three times denser than water and a thousand times more viscous so Arnold you&amp;#39;ll just splatter on it but if you survive the fall the scorching gases will burn your lungs the temperature of lava is 1,000° C four times hotter than an oven so your skin and nerve endings will burn instantly and you&amp;#39;ll feel pain for half a second as the pain signal travels from your skin cells to your brain however bones can burn for a long time at a temperature of 1,000° up to an hour and a half by the way if lava simply flows over you covering you in burning Ash and pmus your insides will burn but the Ash and pmus will form a shell and your descendants will find you after 2,000 years as inhabitants of Pompei did you know that c cows are to blame for global warming methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and all the cows on Earth produce about 150 million tons of it annually this accounts for 8% of the total methane in the atmosphere in theory if cows were to disappear or if we were to consume them all the methane levels would decrease consequently the average temperature of the planet would drop by 2 to 8° f however without cows we would miss out on 210 million gallons of milk each year what would you choose saving the planet or having cereal for breakfast did you decide to get a pet for yourself just not a crocodile around a, people become victims of crocodiles each year whereas Lions only eat about 200 people per year for you it will all end with meeting teeth crocodiles don&amp;#39;t chew they tear apart their food you definitely won&amp;#39;t be swallowed alive even prehistoric 12 M crocodiles couldn&amp;#39;t afford that due to their narrow jaws and they hunted dinosaurs you got lucky but here&amp;#39;s the surprise now you can expect hours of interactive fun with rock grinding crocodiles swallow rocks which act as Mills crushing the bones of their prey and the Rocks also help regulate buoyancy it&amp;#39;s easier for heavy crocodiles to submerge in water good luck Arie see you in a week deal want to experience your own past life try hypnosis wow Arnold you had such a great past life or not in reality past lives don&amp;#39;t exist they&amp;#39;re just false memories created by the brain what a person remembers under hypnosis as a past life is a compilation of what they&amp;#39;ve seen or read psychotherapists use this technique to solve certain problems but it can dangerous for example one patient during a past life regression session felt as though he was lying in a coffin he began to suffocate after the session the man experienced reoccurring panic attacks and breathing problems therefore only a licensed therapist should conduct hypnosis sessions or a bum right Arnold will you survive if you lose 50% of the water in your body
